# GHS-Project
My name is Ben. I am a year 13 NCEA level 3 student, my project is about making a novel/movie about plants and nature. My Digital Outcome is to make a superhero movie/game that is going to be based on plants and nature.
Iâ€™m doing this so I could give an understanding about nature, for example like when someone tries to destroy something people love like a plant we must take a stand to prevent it from happening.
The purpose is about protecting the environment.
